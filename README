# Description
Included in this project are six tests:
- create space
- delete space
- add content
- content md5
- content property
- delete content

By commenting out all but one of them in StorageProviderTester, a given test 
can be run.
Additionally, by selecting either 'do_test' or 'cleanup', the test will be run
or the by-products of a previously run test will be removed.

In the constructor of StorageProviderTestBase, the following options should be 
specified:
- test file
- number of content items
- number of spaces (containers)
- store mapping (storeId -> store name)
